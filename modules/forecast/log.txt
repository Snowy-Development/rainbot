RainBot [00:13:47][log] message -> #Neverfree : ThatAnonPony But either way, the fuel tanks didn't form a complete seal on the runway, so it leaked.

RainBot [00:53:59][log] action -> #Neverfree : Lavish grips Eventide by her collar and yanks her away, dragging her on her back across the tile floor, "Well.

RainBot [01:05:44][log] action -> #Neverfree : Eventide simply lets herself get dragged across the floor. She’s not sure why she couldn’t just /walk/ with Lavish, but again, she doesn’t really feel like questioning him. Whatever he’s got in mind is certainly… intriguing, and while she’s still not so sure, she’s certainly interested in helping him out. “Uh-huh… And I suppose your err… toys…
RainBot [01:05:44][log] action -> #Neverfree : Eventide are in that briefcase?” She stands herself up and dusts herself off while she looks at the very strange looking thing. It’s certainly rather big. Then again, Lavish is a big pony, so to scale, it’s just about right. “Wait, I need to wear a what?”
RainBot [01:06:10][log] action -> #Neverfree : Sparkler spots ThatAnonPony and trots over to them. She unties the fabric around her back and holds out a small sapphire gemstone to them. The jewel was cut and appeared to be about the right size to fit a ring.
RainBot [01:07:43][log] action -> #Neverfree : ThatAnonPony noses at Sparkler in greeting, then looks down at the sapphire. "You moving on from coins to gems, Sparks?"
RainBot [01:09:49][log] action -> #Neverfree : Lavish wraps his hoof around Eventide's head and pulls her in for a quick kiss, "You are such a silly filly when you play dumb," he jests at her before pulling his hoof away and moving to the opposite side of the suit case, "I picked this one for you, go on! Try it, fit yourself into it. Its made for you to curl up in the fetal position and relax there. I want to make sure I have a comfortable...
RainBot [01:09:50][log] action -> #Neverfree : Lavish ...place of isolation for you, something that will caress your body well," he moves back over to her and gives her rump a little tap to push her along.... And be Lavish.

RainBot [01:11:43][log] action -> #Neverfree : Sparkler tilts her head, "Huh? I started with gems. That's how I got my cutie mark after all." She pushes the gem closer, then tilts it upright so that her etched side was facing upwards. On the face of the gem, it had a picture of ThatAnonPony's non-descript cutie mark, though they might not be able to see it without holding it up closely. "Isn't it great? I made it just for you!"
RainBot [01:12:00][log] action -> #Neverfree : Dustrunner drags Cobalt_Blitz off to some strange place full of stallion cocks and pillows

The poor little thestral is just looking more confused every second. She takes another look at the case he’d brought out and takes a deep breath. It at least /looks/ kind of comfortable. What harm would there be in spending a little time in there? “Alright,
RainBot [01:31:48][log] action -> #Neverfree : Eventide Lavish. What is it?” She asks, lowering herself a little and laying on her side to pull her hindlegs in. She curls herself up a little further to make room for her head and lays it down as well. She’s… a lot more comfortable in here than she’d have ever imagined, but that’s definitely no reason to complain. “Alright, now what?”
RainBot [01:31:48][log] action -> #Neverfree : Eventide fine. But only because you’re a big goof when you’re not being evil and I think that’s really cute.” She giggles, and nuzzles at his shoulder as she walks by him, still eyeing the suitcase curiously.

The whole thing has gotten

While the fit is nice and tight, it’s certainly not got the same…
