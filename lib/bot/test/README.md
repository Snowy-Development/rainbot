## Tests
The tests here are all pretty much a work in progress. Some stand true to the
principles of TDD (write tests first, then code) but most do not. I apologize
if that offends anyone. Still, I write the tests at one point or another. Each
test has an integrity marker as its first line and marks how well developed the
the tests that lie therein are. Following are the index definitions

- 0: Nothing has been tested
- 1: The tests are in the process of being developed
- 2: Most or all of the tests are done, but not exhaustive by any means
- 3: All tests are done, but some may or may not be exhaustive enough
- 4: All tests are done, and all tests are at least becoming exhaustive
- 5: All tests done, and all are exhaustive to a considerable amount
