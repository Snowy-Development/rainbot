__Also we're in very early development and things might not be tidy!__

Rain, a Discord Bot
===================
__With User Plugins (Droplets)__

### Overview

1. [What is Rain](#installation)
2. [Droplets](#premade)

What is Rain<a name="installation"></a>
---------------------------------------

Rain is a discord bot aimed at providing user plugin capabilities. Basically the
idea is to have a bot that can accept user created "droplets", which are
essentially plugins that connect to the bot via MessagePack RPC.

-------------------------------

Currently the droplet system is not implemented yet. We are still working on 
making sure internal listeners and commands work. Have after all that is done
and tested, I'll move on to making the commands. It's a one man army here so 
work will be a little slow. I've got college too...
