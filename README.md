# RainBot
Multipurpose, extensible IRC bot written with node.js

## Overview
RainBot is just another IRC bot among the many already made; it started as something for fun rather than need. That being said, plenty of development has still been going into RainBot, well at least as much as a college student can do without drowning themself in work. The master branch is for versions of the bot that are somewhat stable, but not entirely, stable enough that the bot can be used to a reasonable extent. The development branch is where I do all my work and reflects the most up-to-date changes, bugs, and features.

My time is limited and as such I cannot fill this readme with all the information I would like to, but I will finish it when I finish the next update for bot, which hopefully will be soon.
