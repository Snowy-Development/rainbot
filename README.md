# RainBot

This is current go project for RainBot. It is a total rewrite of the original JavaScript codebase. However, some
features of the bot have dramatically changed, such as the plugin manager (which now uses rpc). We hope that in using
go, RainBot will have improved performance, a better memory footprint and better maintainability. This readme will
be updated as early development releases are pushed out.
